# Player Reference

## Starting the game

The game can be started by tapping on the game's icon (on Android) or by
double-clicking the program's icon (on Windows). When the game is closed by
the user or the operating system, the current game is automatically saved. You
don't have to worry about your game's progress.

The start screen shows the game's title and some buttons to choose from:

- Start new game: This starts a new game and creates a new character. When the
  newly created character is accepted, the currently stored game is
  overwritten.

- Journey onward: When there's a stored game from a previous session, this
  button is active. When selected, the game is restored and playing can be
  continued.

- Exit: Just exits the game.

## Game screen

The game screen consists of several areas, showing the game's user interface.
On the left side of the game window, the game's current map is shown,
including the player and all objects in view. Walls, mountains and dense
forest may obscure some of the map.

The right side of the game window is split in three areas: The party list, the
message scroll and the action buttons. The party list shows all members of the
adventuring party, including an icon, the name and the current health.

The message scroll prints the selected actions and any text resulting from
those. The message scroll can be scrolled up, e.g. to look up past events.
Finally, the action buttons lets you start actions, e.g. looking at objects.
